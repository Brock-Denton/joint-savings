# Joint-Savings
A solidity smart contract for handling savings between two account owners 

---
Other addresses can deposit to the joint account. 

The account owners set the addresses they can withdraw to and they can only transfer up to the amount they have or receive an error. 

The account owners have the ability to see what address withdrew last and what amount was associated with the transaction. 

The smart contract deals with the ERC20 ETH.
